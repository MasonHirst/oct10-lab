        <h1>The Evolution of Memes</h1>
        <h3>By Mason Hirst</h3>
    </header>



    <main>
        <p>Memes have come a long way since the creation of the internet</p>
        
        <div class="memes">
            <img src="cat-meme.jpg" height=250px/>
            <span>Did you laught? Boomer.</span>
            <img src="internet.jpg" height=250px/>
        </div>

        <p>Memes started as a funny or relatable picture, which was usually captioned humorously</p>
        <br/>
       
        <h3>Unfortunately,</h3>
        <p>Memes have "evolved", leading to them becoming more random and only funny to certain audiences</p>
        <p>Memes today are like in-depth sport conversations. Someone who doesn't watch football obsessively will not enjoy a deep conversation about niche rules. Similarly, memes today require large amounts of prior meme knowledge, and a knowledge of nearly infinite cultural references.</p>
        
        <div class="memes">
            <img src="2022-meme.png" height=250px/>
            <span>Do you see what I mean?</span>
            <img src="mogus.webp" height=250px/>
        </div>
       
        <h3>There is one more type of meme, which is not to be had among respectable memers</h3>
        <p>Enter, the facebook memes</p>
        <p>The prime example of facebook crime is the minion meme</p>
       
        
        <div class="memes">
            <img src="minion1.jpg" height=250px/>
            <span>I nearly lost my life getting these memes</span>
            <img src="minion-memes-3.jpg" height="250px"/>
        </div>    

        <p>In conclusion, the internet is not kind to outsiders</p>
